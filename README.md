# Walkme-Ionic-App
Walkme within Ionic App 

# Description
Walkme is a platform like a virtual tourist guide, if you know thouses awesome tooltip, send an email to stephanoapiolaza@gmail.com
and visit this website https://www.walkme.com/

# How it Works
It has three plugin, the main is the managment for mozilla firefox (only) and you can do everything with simple clicks, It generates a snippet <code><script src="cdnOfWalkme" type="text/javascript"></script></code> and you´ll paste in your source. 

# If I don´t have access to the source?
You can use the second plugin called Walkme player, It embebed the code within the browser and sincronized with the snippet generated.

Thanks for reading
